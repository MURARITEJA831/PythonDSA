list[start:stop:step]

list = [23,45,67,81,234,567]
list[:4] it prints from starting index to 4-1 index
list[2:] it prints from 2nd index to last index

list[::-1] for reversing the list

list[:] it is also prints compleate list


the differance between list,tuple and string slicing is,
we can create another list by using same list bcoz lists are mutable
but in case of tuples and strings we can create but those two are same so there is no point using the same in one application
